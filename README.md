# Further-Programming
Created by Taylor Neal - s3873735 - s3873735@student.rmit.edu.au 
This Repo will contain all (2) Coding projects from Further Programming at RMIT

This repository is NOT intended for current students of the Futher Programming unit and is intended to be more of a collection where I am able to look back 
and reflect on previous methods/practices that I have since evolved from.

If however, you are a current student of Further Programming at RMIT and you require assistance, please reach out to your tutors. It is what they are there for.
I am also happy to help in the event that a student is referencing my work and would like something explained. 

Do also note that this project was a rushed finish, and will not be updated after grading. Do NOT use my unit tests as reference for yours as I am almost certain that I
did not cover enough in those.
